Notes

This Java program creates a simple text-based notes manager. It uses a command-line menu to let users write new notes to a file and read all the existing notes from that file. The program handles common issues like incorrect input and problems with file operations, making it a robust and practical example of file input/output (I/O) and exception handling.
